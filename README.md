# Hyperminimal demos of using CEF

CEF is great, but has a steep learning curve, and sometimes
examples that are really stripped down are handy.

Here are two such demos.

- [mac](mac)
- [linux](linux)

They also demonstrate how to use a CEF that has been installed a central location.

See also https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/java-cef/issues/109/linux-mac-fix-discovery-of-icudtldat#comment-35461901 for a perhaps better example of how to access a central CEF on Mac.
